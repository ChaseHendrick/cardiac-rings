# Run from the paper's folder (the folder that holds code/ and data/). The programs write their records to
# <root>/results, so this script stages code/ in a scratch folder, with the records of data/ as its results/: the
# committed records in data/ are never overwritten. It then compares the new records with data/ (period enclosures and
# stability bounds must agree; Section 8 of the manuscript states which late digits of Y0, Z1, Z2 and r_existence may
# differ). Exit status 0 only if every step passes.
# These programs and records were computed in the project's study folder; the hashes in the records refer to paths
# relative to that folder, whose layout code/ reproduces.
