"""Link the two cell certificates: is the Fourier orbit's section point inside the CAPD ball? (exact rationals)

Theorem A(i) (results/cell-gks0.0275.json, CAPD) proves: the first-return map g to the section {V = s}, crossed
upward, maps the ball B = {xhat + A(0, y) : ||y_b||_2 <= rho_b for every block b} into itself and is a contraction
there, so it has exactly one fixed point x_c in B. Here xhat, the frame A = [[1, 0], [0, At]] and the blocks and radii
are those of the frame file candidates/cell_frameF.txt, whose SHA-256 the CAPD record stores; everything is in the
scaled variables z = x / sigma (model/scales.txt), as in the Fourier programs.

Theorem A(ii) (results/fourier-existence-N1.json) proves: a periodic orbit O_F = {phi_*(theta)} with
phi_*(theta) = sum_m a*_m e^{i m theta}, ||a*_k - abar_k||_nu <= r_ex for every component k (weights 1, nu >= 1), and
phi_{*,V}(0) = s / sigma_V exactly (the phase condition), where abar is the exact centre
fourier/data/centre_N1_K32.json, whose SHA-256 the Fourier record stores.

Claim checked here. p := phi_*(0) lies in B. Proof of the consequence (written out in the paper, Theorem A): p is on
the section; since g maps B into B, g^k(p) is in B for all k, and g^k(p) -> x_c by the contraction. Each g^k(p) lies on
the closed set O_F (g follows the flow from p), so x_c lies on O_F, and the orbit of x_c, which is the CAPD orbit, is
O_F. So the two certificates enclose the same periodic orbit; its period lies in both period enclosures (checked
below as well: the Fourier interval lies inside the CAPD interval).

How. |p_k - pbar_k| <= sum_m |a*_{k,m} - abar_{k,m}| <= ||a*_k - abar_k||_nu <= r_ex for the free components k = 1..17,
where pbar = phibar(0) = abar_0 + 2 Re sum_{m=1}^{K} abar_m is an exact rational. With d = p_free - xhat_free and
y = At^{-1} d: At is read as the doubles the C++ verifier reads (Python's float() and C++ stream extraction both round
correctly to nearest), inverted EXACTLY in rational arithmetic; y = At^{-1}(pbar_free - xhat_free) + At^{-1} e with
|e_k| <= r_ex, so |y_k - yc_k| <= r_ex * sum_j |(At^{-1})_{kj}|. Then for each block b,
||y_b||_2 <= ||yc_b||_2 + ||delta_b||_2, and both square roots are bounded above exactly (integer square roots), and
the bound must be < rho_b. No floating-point number enters a decision. Exit status 0 only if every check passes.
