"""Stage E: computer-assisted existence and local uniqueness of the rotating 1-wave of the N-cell ring (Arb).

Status: computed; awaiting adversarial review. Nothing written by this program is "verified" until a second
reading has checked the argument below against the code.

0. Problem
----------
Scaled variables z = x / sigma (sigma_i = 2^SCALE_EXP[i], model/scales.txt, exact). f = arbmodel.f is Erhardt's
18-state TP06 endocardial field in these variables, with the model's decimals enclosed exactly (fourier/arbmodel.py).
The ring of N cells is dz_j/dt = f(z_j) + c E (z_{j-1} - 2 z_j + z_{j+1}), indices mod N, c = N^2 D, D = 1/64000 per
ms, E = projection on the V component (component 0); this is arbmodel.ring_field (the coupling is linear and acts on V
only, so it is the same in scaled and physical V). N = 1 is the uncoupled cell.

We look for z_j(t) = phi(omega t + 2 pi j / N), phi: R -> R^18 2 pi periodic, omega > 0. Then
    dz_j/dt = omega phi'(theta_j),   z_{j +- 1}(t) = phi(theta_j +- 2 pi / N),   theta_j = omega t + 2 pi j / N,
so z solves the ring iff omega phi'(theta) = f(phi(theta)) + c E (phi(theta - 2pi/N) - 2 phi(theta) + phi(theta + 2pi/N))
for all theta. With phi = sum_m a_m e^{i m theta} the coupling acts on mode m as c (e^{-2 pi i m/N} - 2 + e^{2 pi i m/N})
= -4 c sin^2(pi m / N) = -d_m (arbmodel.damping(m, N=N); d_m = 0 for N = 1). Unknowns x = (omega, a), a = (a_m)_{m in Z},
a_m in C^18, and
    F_ph(x) = sum_m a_{m,V} - s / sigma_V,                         s = the double nearest 0.2 (as proofs/verify.cpp)
    F_m(x)  = i omega m a_m - g_m(a) + d_m E a_m,   m in Z,          g(a) = f o phi_a,  g_m = its Fourier coefficients.

1. Spaces and norms
-------------------
nu = e^{rho0} (rho0 an exact dyadic; nu is used as an Arb ball containing e^{rho0}). l^1_nu = {(b_m) : ||b||_nu =
sum_m |b_m| nu^|m| < inf}, a Banach algebra under convolution (||b * c||_nu <= ||b||_nu ||c||_nu since nu^|m| <=
nu^|m-n| nu^|n|). X = C x (l^1_nu)^18 with ||x|| = max(|omega| / eta_om, max_k ||a_k||_nu / eta_k), eta > 0 fixed
weights (default 1). For a linear B on X with blocks B_{cc'} (c, c' in {om, 0..17}):
    ||B|| <= max_c (1 / eta_c) sum_{c'} eta_{c'} ||B_{cc'}||,  ||B_{cc'}||_{l^1_nu -> l^1_nu} = sup_{m'} sum_m |B(m, m')| nu^{|m|} / nu^{|m'|}
(the column sup; om counts as a component with the single mode 0). Standard: ||(Bx)_c|| <= sum_{c'} ||B_{cc'}|| ||x_{c'}||
<= sum_{c'} ||B_{cc'}|| eta_{c'} ||x||. Every such bound below is evaluated in Arb from entrywise |.| upper bounds.

2. The centre and the operator A
--------------------------------
xbar = (omega_bar, abar): exact dyadic numbers from fourier/data/centre_N{N}_K{K}.json (centre.py, untrusted), abar_m = 0
for |m| > K, abar_{-m} = conj(abar_m), omega_bar real.
J(theta) = Df(phibar(theta)) = sum_n J_n e^{i n theta} (18 x 18). DF(xbar) y, for y = (y_om, y_a):
    phase:   sum_m y_{m,V}
    row m:   i y_om m abar_m + i omega_bar m y_m - sum_n J_n y_{m-n} + d_m E y_m.
A is block diagonal with respect to (modes |m| <= K plus omega) and (each mode |m| > K):
  * A_fin: an exact complex matrix of size n = 1 + 18 (2K+1), the double-precision inverse of the midpoint of the
    Galerkin matrix J_fin (the restriction of DF(xbar) to rows phase, |m| <= K and columns omega, |m'| <= K);
  * A_m = (i omega_bar m I - J0hat + d_m E)^{-1} for |m| > K, with J0hat the exact real midpoint matrix of the
    enclosure of J_0. A_m exists for every |m| > K: for K < |m| <= m_max it is computed by Arb inversion of a point
    matrix (Arb raises if the ball matrix is not certainly invertible), beyond m_max by the Neumann bound of section 4.
    A_{-m} = conj(A_m) (J0hat real, d_{-m} = d_m), so only m > 0 is computed.
A is injective: A_m are inverses, and A_fin is invertible because ||I - A_fin J_fin|| <= Z1 < 1 (the compression
P (I - A DF(xbar)) P to the finite modes equals I - A_fin J_fin, and ||P|| = 1 in X).

3. Theorem used (Newton-Kantorovich / radii polynomial)
------------------------------------------------------
T(x) = x - A F(x). For r <= r_* (r_* < min_k R_k / eta_k, R the polydisc radii of section 6) T is defined and C^1 on
the closed ball B_r(xbar) of X (section 6: g is analytic there; the term A (i omega m a_m) is a bounded bilinear map
because sup_{|m|>K} |m| |A_m| is finite, section 4; A(d_m E a_m) and the phase are bounded linear). Suppose
    ||A F(xbar)|| <= Y0,   ||I - A DF(xbar)|| <= Z1,   ||A (DF(x) - DF(xbar))|| <= Z2 ||x - xbar|| on B_{r_*}(xbar).
Then ||DT(x)|| <= Z1 + Z2 ||x - xbar||, and for x in B_r(xbar):
    ||T(x) - xbar|| <= ||T(xbar) - xbar|| + ||int_0^1 DT(xbar + t (x - xbar)) (x - xbar) dt|| <= Y0 + Z1 r + Z2 r^2 / 2.
If p(r) := Y0 + (Z1 - 1) r + Z2 r^2 / 2 < 0 and Z1 + Z2 r < 1, T maps B_r(xbar) into itself and is a contraction
there (mean value inequality on the convex ball, constant Z1 + Z2 r), so T has exactly one fixed point in B_r(xbar);
fixed points of T are exactly the zeros of F (A injective). Both inequalities are checked in Arb at exact dyadic r.

4. Tail of A (rigorous over all |m| > K)
----------------------------------------
For K < m <= m_max: A_m from Arb (point matrix, exact d_m from arbmodel.damping); entrywise |A_m|, |m A_m| and
|A_m J'_n| (J'_n = J_n for n != 0, J'_0 = J_0 - J0hat, J_n balls) are bounded directly.
For m > m_max, y = omega_bar m >= Y := omega_bar (m_max + 1): with B0 = J0hat - d_m E, A_m = (i y)^{-1} sum_k (B0/(i y))^k,
and entrywise |B0| <= G0 := |J0hat| + dmax E, dmax >= every d_m (dmax = 4 c). With G = G0 / Y and theta = ||G||_inf < 1:
    |A_m| <= (1/y) sum_k (G0/y)^k <= (1/Y) S_G,   |m A_m| = (y / omega_bar) |A_m| <= (1/omega_bar) S_G,
    S_G := I + G + G^2 + theta^3 / (1 - theta) * ones   (each entry of sum_{k>=3} G^k is <= its row sum <= theta^3/(1-theta)),
and |A_m J'_n| <= |A_m| |J'_n|. m_max is an integer with theta <= theta_target (setting): the code starts from a
float guess and increases it until om_bar (m_max + 1) theta_target >= ||G0||_inf is certified, so it may exceed the
least such integer; this is harmless, since theta is recomputed from the actual Y and certified < 1. The sup bounds
Abar0 = sup_{|m|>K} |A_m|, Abar1 = sup |m A_m|, C_n = sup |A_m J'_n| are entrywise maxima over both ranges. Negative m:
A_{-m} = conj(A_m), so |A_{-m}| = |A_m| and |A_{-m} J'_n| = |A_m conj(J'_n)|, bounded by an explicit product with the
conjugated enclosure. For |n| <= n_explicit the products A_m J'_n (m and -m) are formed explicitly for K < m <= m_max;
for n_explicit < |n| <= K' the bound C_n = Abar0 |J'_n| (entrywise, |A_m J'_n| <= |A_m| |J'_n| <= Abar0 |J'_n|) is used.

5. Y0 and Z1
------------
Fourier data (fourier_eval.py, Lemmas 1-3 there): g_m enclosures for |m| <= K' (K' = 2K + L) from an M-node DFT at
Pg bits with the aliasing bound and strip sup S_g on |Im theta| <= rho; J_n enclosures for |n| <= K' likewise with the
strip sup S_J (entrywise, 324 components); beyond K': |g_{k,m}| <= S_{g,k} e^{-rho |m|}, |J_{n,jk}| <= S_{J,jk} e^{-rho |n|}.
q := nu e^{-rho} < 1, sum_{|n| > K'} (nu e^{-rho})^{|n|} = 2 q^{K'+1} / (1 - q).

Y0. F(xbar) has finite part (phase, |m| <= K): computed in Arb (enclosures of g_m); A F(xbar) finite = A_fin F_fin.
Tail rows m (|m| > K): F_m(xbar) = -g_m (abar_m = 0 there), so (A F)_m = -A_m g_m: for K < |m| <= K' with the
computed A_m (or Abar0 |g_m| if m > m_max) and the g_m enclosure; for |m| > K', |A_m g_m| <= Abar0 S_g e^{-rho |m|},
summed in closed form.
Y0 = max_c (1/eta_c) (||(A F)_c, finite||_nu + ||(A F)_c, tail||_nu).

Z1. B := I - A DF(xbar). Columns of B indexed by (k, m'):
  * finite rows (phase / |m| <= K), finite columns: I - A_fin J_fin, an Arb matrix product (prec P_mat);
  * finite rows, tail columns (|m'| > K): -A_fin w^{(k,m')}, w^{(k,m')} = (phase: delta_{kV}; row (j,m): -J_{m-m',jk})
    (the phase functional sums over all m, and the convolution reaches across). For K < |m'| <= K + L, |m - m'| <= K'
    and the J enclosures are used (exact product A_fin w). For |m'| >= K + L + 1, |J_{m-m',jk}| <= S_{J,jk} e^{-rho |m - m'|}
    and |m - m'| = |m'| - sgn(m') m (|m| <= K < |m'|), so |A_fin w| <= |A_fin| wbar(m') entrywise, and the weighted column
    sum of |A_fin| wbar(m') divided by nu^{|m'|} is a sum of terms each proportional to nu^{-|m'|} (phase entry) or
    (e^{-rho} / nu)^{|m'|}: decreasing in |m'|. So its value at |m'| = K + L + 1 bounds the sup over all |m'| >= K + L + 1.
  * tail rows m (|m| > K), all columns: since A_m (i omega_bar m - J0hat + d_m E) = I,
        (B y)_m = A_m [ (J_0 - J0hat) y_m + sum_{n != 0} J_n y_{m-n} ] = sum_n A_m J'_n y_{m-n},
    (y_om does not enter: i y_om m abar_m = 0 for |m| > K) and, using nu^{|m|} <= nu^{|m-n|} nu^{|n|},
        ||(B y)_c, tail||_nu <= sum_k T_{ck} ||y_k||,   T := sum_{|n| <= K'} C_n nu^{|n|} + Abar0 S_J 2 q^{K'+1} / (1 - q).
  For each output component c and input component c', the column sup over m' of finite rows plus tail rows is at most
  max(finite-rows sup over finite columns, finite-rows sup over tail columns) + T_{cc'}.
  Z1 = max_c (1/eta_c) sum_{c'} eta_{c'} (that bound).

6. Z2 by a polydisc majorant
----------------------------
Radii R_k > 0 (exact). M_k >= sup |f_k(phibar(theta) + w)| over |Im theta| <= rho2, |w_j| <= R_j: strip_sup of f over the
trigonometric polynomial whose constant coefficient a_{0,j} is replaced by the complex box of half-width R_j around it
(the box contains the disc |w_j| <= R_j, so phibar(theta) + w lies in that family for every such w). A finite cover
also certifies that f is holomorphic on an open set containing the compact set {phibar(theta) + w} (fourier_eval Lemma 1
and the contract on F), and the set of evaluation points is invariant under w -> conj w, theta -> conj theta.
(i) Cauchy: c_alpha(theta) := d^alpha f_k(phibar(theta)) / alpha! is holomorphic near the strip, 2 pi periodic and
    |c_alpha(theta)| <= M_k R^{-alpha} (Cauchy's inequality on the closed polydisc, for each theta in the strip).
(ii) Strip to l^1_nu: by fourier_eval Lemma 2, |[c_alpha]_m| <= M_k R^{-alpha} e^{-rho2 |m|}, hence
    ||c_alpha||_nu <= M_k R^{-alpha} Q2,   Q2 = sum_m (nu e^{-rho2})^{|m|} = (1 + q2) / (1 - q2),  q2 = nu e^{-rho2} < 1.
(iii) For h in (l^1_nu)^18 with ||h_j||_nu < R_j: g_k(abar + h) = sum_alpha c_alpha h^alpha in l^1_nu (h^alpha a
    convolution power). The series converges absolutely in the Banach algebra (by (ii) it is dominated by
    Phi_k(t) := M_k Q2 prod_j (1 - t_j / R_j)^{-1} at t_j = ||h_j||_nu); for real theta, |h_j(theta)| <= ||h_j||_nu < R_j, so the
    Taylor series of f_k at phibar(theta) converges to f_k(phibar(theta) + h(theta)); l^1_nu convergence is uniform
    convergence, so the two functions, and their Fourier coefficients, agree. Hence a -> g(a) is analytic on that
    polydisc-ball and its derivatives are majorized termwise by those of Phi_k (all majorant coefficients >= 0):
        ||D^2 g_k(abar + h)[u, v]||_nu <= sum_{j,l} d_j d_l Phi_k(||h||) ||u_j|| ||v_l||.
(iv) For x = xbar + delta in B_r (|delta_om| <= eta_om r, ||delta a_k|| <= eta_k r) and ||y|| <= 1:
        (DF(x) - DF(xbar)) y = i m (y_om delta a_m + delta_om y_m) - (Dg(abar + delta a) - Dg(abar)) y_a.
    First term: b := y_om delta a + delta_om y_a has ||b_k|| <= 2 eta_om eta_k r; ||A (i m b)||_c <= sum_k (N1 + Abar1)_{ck}
    ||b_k||, N1 = block norms of A_fin diag(i m) (finite part), Abar1 = sup_{|m|>K} |m A_m| (tail rows).
    Second term: = int_0^1 D^2 g(abar + t delta a)[delta a, y_a] dt, and by (iii) and monotonicity of d_j d_l Phi_k,
        ||.||_k <= r W_k(r),  W_k(r) = sum_{j,l} eta_j eta_l d_j d_l Phi_k(eta r) = M_k Q2 P(r) [ (sum_j s_j)^2 + sum_j s_j^2 ],
        s_j = eta_j / (R_j - eta_j r),  P(r) = prod_j R_j / (R_j - eta_j r)
    (d_j P = P / (R_j - t_j), d_l d_j P = P / ((R_j - t_j)(R_l - t_l)) for j != l and 2 P / (R_j - t_j)^2 for j = l). Then
    ||A w||_c <= sum_k (N0 + Abar0)_{ck} ||w_k||, N0 = block norms of A_fin on the a-columns (no phase input).
    Z2 := max_c (1/eta_c) sum_k [ 2 eta_om eta_k (N1 + Abar1)_{ck} + (N0 + Abar0)_{ck} W_k(r_*) ]   (W increasing in r).
    For the omega output row (c = om) only the finite parts N0, N1 enter (A has no tail in that row).

7. Real solution, period, wave number
-------------------------------------
kappa(omega, a) := (conj omega, (conj a_{-m})_m) is an isometry of X and kappa(xbar) = xbar. F(kappa x) = kappa'(F(x)) with
kappa'(F_ph, (F_m)) = (conj F_ph, (conj F_{-m})). Why f(conj z) = conj f(z) holds pointwise at every point that is used:
fourier/tp06_18d_arb.py (audited 2026-10-01: it contains only +, -, *, /, integer powers, 55 calls of exp, 4 of log,
3 of sqrt, real constants _D/_I, and no abs, Re/Im, comparison, branch or float conversion) evaluates f as a fixed
composition of these operations. Each one commutes with conjugation wherever it is defined: +, -, *, / and integer
powers algebraically, exp because its power series has real coefficients, and the principal log and sqrt on
{Re > 0} (the only arguments arbmodel admits, guarded), because that set is conjugation-invariant and
Log(conj w) = conj Log(w), sqrt(conj w) = conj sqrt(w) off (-inf, 0]. So, by induction over the expression, if z is in
the certified domain (every intermediate log/sqrt argument has Re > 0, every divisor is nonzero), then so is conj z,
and f(conj z) = conj f(z), point by point, with no connectedness argument. The points that occur are
phibar(theta) + h(theta) with theta real and |h_j(theta)| <= ||h_j||_nu < R_j; this family is closed under conjugation
(phibar(theta) is real for real theta, and |conj h_j| = |h_j|), and it lies in the domain certified by the polydisc
cover of section 6. Hence phi_{kappa a}(theta) = conj phi_a(theta) for real theta, g(kappa a)(theta) = conj g(a)(theta),
and g_m(kappa a) = conj g_{-m}(a);
d_{-m} = d_m is real and s / sigma_V is real. So kappa maps zeros of F in B_r(xbar) to zeros in B_r(xbar); by uniqueness
the zero x* = kappa x*: omega* is real and phi* is real-valued. Since a* in (l^1_nu)^18 and i omega* m a*_m =
g_m - d_m E a*_m is in l^1_nu, phi* is C^1 (indeed analytic on |Im theta| < rho0) and solves the profile equation
pointwise; omega* >= omega_bar - eta_om r > 0, so z_j(t) = phi*(omega* t + 2 pi j / N) is a real T-periodic solution of
the ring, T = 2 pi / omega*. |a*_{1,V} - abar_{1,V}| <= eta_V r / nu; the program checks |abar_{1,V}| > eta_V r / nu,
so a*_{1,V} != 0. A function with minimal period 2 pi / k (k >= 2) has a_m = 0 unless k | m; hence phi* is nonconstant
with minimal period 2 pi, each z_j has minimal period T, the solution is not synchronous for N >= 2 (that would make
phi* 2 pi / N periodic), and it is a 1-wave: z_j(t) = z_0(t + j T / N); if also z_j(t) = z_0(t + j k T / N) for all j with
k != 1 mod N, z_0 would have period (k - 1) T / N mod T, contradicting minimality.

python-flint 0.9.0 (Arb), fourier/arbmodel.py with the generated fourier/tp06_18d_arb.py (exact decimals), the strip

double inverse) are untrusted inputs: they are exact numbers chosen by an untrusted program; their quality only
