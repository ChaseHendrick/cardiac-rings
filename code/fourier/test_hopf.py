"""Acceptance tests and negative controls for hopf.py (the Hopf gap). Each test can fail.

Modes (run under nice with a timeout; the machine is shared):
  --bookkeeping-only     synthetic evidence tampering and exact-cover controls only (seconds, no scientific rerun).
  --fast                 quick mode: everything below except the re-proofs of pieces 13, 30, 40, 62 and the last
                         one, the piece-13 controls and the last piece's float checks (piece 0 is re-proved);
  (no flag)              full mode: re-proves pieces 0, 13, 30, 40, 62 and the last one (about 100 s each);
  --rerun-theorem-a      adds a rerun of hopf.theorem_A into a temporary directory (about 240 s) whose record must
                         equal fourier/data/hopf/theoremA_final.json in every field but the run time.
  PYTHONPATH=<python-flint 0.9.0> nice -n 10 timeout 2400 python3 test_hopf.py [--fast] [--rerun-theorem-a]
  The re-proof of ALL logged pieces is not a test: `python3 hopf.py --reprove-all --workers W` writes
  fourier/data/hopf/reprove_final.jsonl, and `hopf.py --collect` reports which pieces have a matching re-proof.

Infrastructure
  * Jet (truncated Taylor series): exp, log, sqrt, reciprocal, integer powers against closed-form Taylor
    coefficients; enclosure on a ball (random points of the input ball give coefficients inside the output balls).
  * field_jet: [t] = D f v (arbmodel.f_and_df), 2 [t^2] = D^2 f[v, v] (branch.Hess); field_jet_dual's [t].d = D^2 f[v, .];
    curve_point ('hess', 'dual_tau') against field_jet_dual and Hess at the same point.
  * lyap1 on the four systems with known l1 of papers/hh-dynamics (two planar, two coupled four-dimensional, both
    signs); the mutated routines ('sign': +2 in the middle term; 'no2iw': (-A)^-1) must miss the known value.
Theorem A
  * Lemma K refuses a polydisc that does not contain the equilibrium (centre shifted, radii kept).
  * At G_H: the 16 other Gershgorin discs lie in Re < 0, d Re lambda / dg < 0, l1 < 0 (and omega l1 agrees with
    Erhardt's -2.6838 to about four significant digits). The conjugate of the eigenvalue ball avoids every Gershgorin
    disc but D2 (the check added to spectrum_on for GAP 1 of the 2026-10-02 review); the same test with D1 exempted
    instead of D2 fails. Negative
    controls: "l1 > 0" (the wrong sign assumed) is refused by the enclosure; the interval G_H shifted by 1e-9 to the
    right does not contain the crossing (Re lambda < 0 at its left end, so the left-side sign condition of the cover
    fails), and shifted to the left Re lambda > 0 at its right end; dlambda_dg told that the critical disc is the
    conjugate's refuses the left eigenpair (it is identified with lambda only through D1).
  * The record theoremA_final.json was written by the current hopf.py (its code_sha256), and its cover passes
    hopf.check_theoremA_cover (adjacent intervals covering W with G_H between the sides, the recorded counts, the signs
    of Re lambda, others_max_re < 0 and equal to the recorded upper bound, transversality, l1 < 0); negative controls:
    a cover with one interval removed, with one sign flipped, or ending short of W is refused.
Theorem B (needs the run data, fourier/data/hopf/)
  * Pieces 0 (fast mode) or 0, 13, 30, 40, 62 and the last one (full mode) are re-proved by hopf.reprove_piece (the
    function of `hopf.py --reprove-all`) from their stored centres, weights and r_*, with their groups' covers rebuilt
    from the logged centres: the cover digests equal the logged ones, and Y0, Z1, Z2, the radii, p at the radii, the
    contraction factor and g/omega/period enclosures are freshly certified exact bounds; historical equality is
    diagnostic only (pieces 0 to 30 were made before
    the program logged its own hash, and the later runs logged hashes of earlier program texts; this ties a piece of
    each run, K = 8 and K = 12, to the current program text). The comparison refuses a log line whose Y0 differs in
    the last bit, and reprove_status counts a re-proof only for the current program hash and the current log line.
  * Negative controls: on piece 0, dropping the curve terms (delta Y1, delta^2 Y2 / 2, delta Zc) changes Y0 and Z1,
    dropping the Cauchy (third-derivative) terms changes Z2, and a piece reaching beyond its cover is refused; on piece
    13, a tight piece, the parameter interval widened threefold about its centre (cover rebuilt for it) must fail, and
    so must a centre line computed at a wrong eps (e_hi + (e_hi - e_lo)/2, one piece width above the midpoint), each
    with the message "radii polynomial not negative" (any other failure, such as a cover or domain error, fails the
    control). (On piece 0, which is far from tight, both are valid proofs; the controls were moved to piece 13 and
    the message check added on 2026-10-02.)
  * Float cross-checks (piece 0 in both modes, the last piece in full mode; float Galerkin matrices with 192 nodes,
    finite modes only): ||A d^2/dxi^2 F|| and ||A d/dxi DF|| lie below the rigorous Y2 and Zc and above a thirtieth of
    them; ||A d/dxi F|| at e_c (central difference along the tangent) lies below the rigorous Y1; and a lower estimate
    of Z2 (||A (DF(xbar + D) - DF(xbar))|| / r over random corner perturbations D of norm r = r_hi, then hill climbing)
    lies below the rigorous Z2. These are sanity checks, not proofs.
  * Gluing: every consecutive pair of logged pieces re-glues in Arb; with r_hi replaced by r_lo, or with a piece glued
    to a non-adjacent one, the check fails.
Corollary B(a) (needs theoremA_final.json)
  * The identification at eps = 0 passes; negative controls: the default (not enlarged) equilibrium polydisc misses
    c*(0)'s enclosure; without the recorded polydiscs of the left intervals the identification is refused.
Lemma D and the gluing (Part C)
  * At least one G_Ks point proof is identified with the eps-branch. Negative controls: the same profile claimed at a
    G_Ks shifted by 1e-5, a point radius of 1/64, a point centre that does not match its digest, an eps-branch cut
    before the point's eps: all refused.
  * If a gluing point is recorded: it is re-derived (on the G_Ks branch by branch.point_on_branch, on the eps-branch by
    Lemma D). Two controls on the G_Ks side: (a) the containment guard refuses the two pieces adjacent to the glue
    piece (they do not contain g); on those the ball inclusion alone would hold (found 2026-10-02), so the guard is
    needed; (b) with the guard bypassed (a copy of the piece record widened to contain g), the ball inclusion itself
    fails on the pieces three positions before and after the glue piece.
The record (results/fourier-hopf.json)
  * Every stored source and data SHA-256 equals the file on disk; the piece count, eps range and Theorem A enclosures
    are those of the logs; the status is the agreed one; the Theorem A cover checks are recorded as passed; the
    re-proof report equals hopf.reprove_status() now; a one-byte change in pieces.jsonl changes its hash.
Sign and widening controls asked for in the brief: a sign-flipped l1 (the 'sign' mutation and "l1 > 0" refused), a
perturbed equilibrium (the shifted Lemma K polydisc), a widened eps range (the threefold piece) all fail.
