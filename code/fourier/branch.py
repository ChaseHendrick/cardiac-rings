"""Rec 2: a certified branch of the single-cell periodic orbit over G_Ks intervals toward Erhardt's Hopf point (Arb).

Status: computed; awaiting adversarial review. Nothing written by this program is "verified" until a second reading
has checked the argument below against the code. Section numbers "E.n" refer to the docstring of existence.py
(Stage E), whose machinery is reused here; what differs from Stage E is stated in full.

0. Problem
----------
Single cell (N = 1), scaled variables z = x / sigma, f(z; g) = arbmodel.f with g_Ks = g. G_Ks enters the reference
model only through i_Ks = g_Ks Xs^2 (V - E_Ks) in dV/dt (model/tp06_18d.py, lines 49 and 97), so
    f(z; g) = f(z; g0) + (g - g0) f1(z),    f1 = df/dg (nonzero only in the V row), for all g, g0.        (0.1)
For a closed parameter interval G = [g_lo, g_hi] (exact decimals) we look, for every g in G, for omega > 0 and a
2 pi periodic phi with omega phi' = f(phi; g). Unknowns x = (omega, a), a = (a_m)_{m in Z}, a_m in C^18, and
    F_ph(x)   = a_{1,V} - a_{-1,V}                     (phase condition, see below)
    F_m(x; g) = i omega m a_m - g_m(a; g),   g(a; g) = f(phi_a; g), g_m its Fourier coefficients.
Phase condition. Stage E fixes the phase by V(0) = s = 0.2 mV. Along the branch the orbit's V range shrinks toward
the equilibrium; it no longer reaches 0.2 mV for G_Ks above about 0.02771 (float continuation, section 9), and the
level condition degenerates before that (||A|| grows by 2.5 between 0.0275 and 0.0277). The functional used here is
C-linear and vanishes on real profiles exactly when Im a_{1,V} = 0: theta = 0 is where the first V harmonic is at its
maximum. It is non-degenerate as long as a_{1,V} != 0, which section 7 proves on every piece. The period does not
depend on the phase condition, so periods are directly comparable with Stage E and the CAPD record.

1. Spaces and norms: as E.1, X = C x (l^1_nu)^18, ||x|| = max(|omega| / eta_om, max_k ||a_k||_nu / eta_k), with exact
dyadic weights eta chosen per piece (floating-point optimisation, section 8; only their exactness matters).

2. Centre and A: as E.2, with the centre xbar = (omega_bar, abar) computed (untrusted, section 8) at an exact decimal
g_c in G (the midpoint), exactly symmetric (abar_{-m} = conj abar_m, a_0 real) and with Im abar_{1,V} = 0 exactly, so
F_ph(xbar) = 0. The Galerkin matrix J_fin is the Stage E one with the phase row replaced by the functional above
(entries +1 at (V, 1) and -1 at (V, -1)). Its J_n entries, the Galerkin matrix J_fin and J0hat are enclosures at the
POINT g_c only (piece_blocks evaluates them with the parameters at g_c); the width of G enters Z1 only through the
term delta * B1g, and Y0 only through delta * Y0g (the mean value theorem in g, section 3). A_fin is the double
inverse of the midpoint of J_fin(g_c), A_m (|m| > K) the Stage E tail inverses built from J0hat, the exact midpoint of
the enclosure [J_0(g_c)]. A does not depend on g.

3. Uniform bounds (Theorem B1)
------------------------------
Let G = [g_lo, g_hi], g_c its midpoint (an exact decimal), delta = (g_hi - g_lo) / 2. Every Arb evaluation made "over
G" uses an Arb ball containing [g_lo, g_hi] for g_Ks (arbmodel.params(g_Ks=(lo, hi)), the interval hull of the two
exact decimals), hence contains the values for EVERY g in G. The parameter is handled by the mean value theorem in g
(evaluating F(xbar; g) or DF(xbar; g) directly with the interval ball is also valid, but adds |A| times the ball radii
with no cancellation, which made Z1 = 221 on a 4e-6 wide piece):
  * Y0. For each g in G, A F(xbar; g) = A F(xbar; g_c) + (g - g_c) int_0^1 A d_gF(xbar; g_c + t (g - g_c)) dt, and
    d_gF(xbar; xi) = (0, (-[d_g f(phibar; xi)]_m)_m) (the phase row and i omega m a_m do not depend on g). So, per output
    component c, ||(A F(xbar; g))_c|| <= Y0p_c + delta Y0g_c, where Y0p is the Stage E Y0 computation (E.5: finite part
    A_fin F_fin, tail rows -A_m g_m, Cauchy tail) for the point g_c, and Y0g the same computation for the vector
    d_gF(xbar; xi) with the Fourier enclosures of d_g f o phibar taken over xi in G (strip sup and aliased DFT,
    fourier_eval Lemmas 1-3, of the black box dg_flat; the integral average lies in the convex ball enclosure).
    Y0 := max_c (Y0p_c + delta Y0g_c) / eta_c >= sup_{g in G} ||A F(xbar; g)||.
  * Z1. I - A DF(xbar; g) = [I - A DF(xbar; g_c)] - (g - g_c) int_0^1 A d_gDF(xbar; g_c + t (g - g_c)) dt, where
    d_gDF(xbar; xi) y = (0, (-[(d_g Df)(phibar; xi) y]_m)_m) is the convolution operator with the Fourier coefficients
    D1_n of d_g Df o phibar (enclosed over xi in G; black box dgJ_flat, the mixed second derivatives from Hess with g as
    a 19th variable). Block bounds B1 (the Stage E Z1 blocks for I - A DF(xbar; g_c): finite x finite, finite rows x tail
    columns with the strip majorant, tail rows sum_n A_m J'_n) and B1g (the same three parts for A d_gDF: |A_fin D_fin|,
    A_fin times the tail columns of D1 with its majorant S_D, and tail rows |A_m D1_n| <= Abar0 |D1_n| plus the Cauchy
    tail Abar0 S_D tailK) give, for every g in G,
        ||I - A DF(xbar; g)|| <= Z1 := max_c (1/eta_c) sum_c' eta_c' (B1_{cc'} + delta B1g_{cc'}).
    d_g Df vanishes identically outside the V row (G_Ks enters only dV/dt); the code restricts the products to the
    rows where the enclosures are not exact zeros, which is exact (an exact zero ball contributes nothing), and checks
    that S_D vanishes on the other rows.
  * Z2 (section 4) holds for every g in G (sup of |D^2 f| over the polydisc family with g in the group's interval).
  * A (A_fin = double inverse of the midpoint of the Galerkin matrix at g_c, A_m from J0hat = mid [J_0(g_c)]) does not
    depend on g; it is injective because Z1 < 1 (E.2).
For each fixed g in G define T_g(x) = x - A F(x; g). As in E.3: if p(r) = Y0 + (Z1 - 1) r + Z2 r^2 / 2 < 0 and
Z1 + Z2 r < 1 at r = r_lo, and at r = r_hi <= r_* (both certified in Arb, existence._radii), then for every g in G,
T_g maps B_{r_lo}(xbar) into itself, is a (Z1 + Z2 r_hi)-contraction on B_{r_hi}(xbar), and F(.; g) has exactly one
zero x*(g) in B_{r_hi}(xbar), which lies in B_{r_lo}(xbar). (The proof is split into piece_blocks, every weight-free
rigorous ingredient, and assemble, which applies the weights eta chosen in floating point and decides the inequalities.)

4. Z2 from second derivatives (Lemma B2; replaces E.6)
-----------------------------------------------------
Stage E bounds D^2 g by Cauchy's inequality on an 18-dimensional polydisc of radius R = 2^-10, which costs a factor
(18 / R)^2 and gives Z2 = 6.4e10: then the radii polynomial needs Y0 < 5e-12, and since the parameter width makes
Y0 about ||dx/dg|| (g_hi - g_lo) / 2 with ||dx/dg|| about 1.8e3 (eta = 1), pieces would be 6e-15 wide. Here the
derivative of Dg is bounded through the Hessian of f itself:
  Data. Radii R_i > 0 (exact dyadics) and a closed strip |Im theta| <= rho2, rho2 > rho0. A trigonometric polynomial
  family Phi (TrigPoly with ball coefficients) that contains phibar, with the constant coefficient of component i
  inflated by the complex box of half-width R_i (so Phi(theta) contains phibar(theta) + w for |w_i| <= R_i). An Arb
  evaluation of f and of its Hessian H_{kjl} = d^2 f_k / dz_j dz_l by second-order forward-mode dual numbers (class
  Hess below; every intermediate is checked finite and every log/sqrt argument is certified in Re > 0, so a finite
  result certifies that every intermediate of the expression is holomorphic there; contract of fourier_eval) over a
  full cover of the strip rectangle (fourier_eval.strip_sup, Lemma 1), with g the parameter interval of the group.
  Result: MH_{kjl} >= sup |H_{kjl}(phibar(theta) + w; g)| over |Im theta| <= rho2, |w_i| <= R_i, g in G, and f(.; g)
  holomorphic on an open set U containing that compact set, for each g in G.
  Claim. For a in (l^1_nu)^18 with t_i := ||a_i - abar_i||_nu < R_i, and each g in G:
    (a) g(a; g) and each composite J_{kj} o phi_a, H_{kjl} o phi_a lie in l^1_nu, and
        ||H_{kjl} o phi_a||_nu <= MH_{kjl} Q2 P(t),  Q2 = (1 + q2) / (1 - q2), q2 = nu e^{-rho2}, P(t) = prod_i R_i / (R_i - t_i);
    (b) a -> J_{kj} o phi_a is Frechet differentiable into l^1_nu with derivative h -> sum_l (H_{kjl} o phi_a) * h_l
        (* the convolution product), and Dg(a; g) y = ([sum_j (J_{kj} o phi_a) * y_j])_k.
  Proof. As E.6 (iii), applied to the holomorphic functions H_{kjl}(.; g) and J_{kj}(.; g) instead of f_k: for theta in
  the strip, w -> H_{kjl}(phibar(theta) + w) is holomorphic on a neighbourhood of the closed polydisc |w_i| <= R_i, so its
  Taylor coefficients c_alpha(theta) satisfy |c_alpha(theta)| <= MH R^{-alpha} (Cauchy), are holomorphic and 2 pi
  periodic near the strip, so (fourier_eval Lemma 2) ||c_alpha||_nu <= MH R^{-alpha} Q2; with h = a - abar,
  sum_alpha c_alpha h^alpha converges absolutely in the Banach algebra l^1_nu (dominated by MH Q2 prod (1 - t_i/R_i)^{-1})
  and, for real theta (|h_i(theta)| <= t_i < R_i), pointwise to H_{kjl}(phi_a(theta)); uniform convergence identifies
  the l^1_nu sum with the composite. This gives (a). For (b), the same power series for J_{kj} is an analytic map of h
  on the polydisc-ball, differentiated termwise; its derivative in direction h_l is the series of d_l J_{kj} = H_{kjl},
  i.e. (H_{kjl} o phi_a) * h_l. The formula for Dg is the same statement one order lower (series of f_k). QED.
  Z2. For x = xbar + delta in B_{r*}(xbar) (||delta a_l|| <= eta_l r, |delta_om| <= eta_om r), ||y|| <= 1, every g in G:
    (DF(x; g) - DF(xbar; g)) y = i m (y_om delta a + delta_om y_a) - (Dg(abar + delta a; g) - Dg(abar; g)) y_a.
  The first term is bounded exactly as in E.6 (iv) (N1 + Abar1). For the second, by (b) and the mean value
  inequality in l^1_nu along the segment abar + s delta a (which stays in the polydisc-ball since eta_l r* < R_l),
    ||[(Dg(abar + delta a) - Dg(abar)) y_a]_k||_nu <= sum_{j,l} sup_s ||H_{kjl} o phi_{abar + s delta a}||_nu ||delta a_l|| ||y_j||
                                               <= r W_k,   W_k := Q2 P(eta r*) sum_{j,l} eta_j eta_l MH_{kjl}.
  So, with N0, N1, Abar0, Abar1 as in E.6,
    Z2 := max_c (1/eta_c) sum_k [ 2 eta_om eta_k (N1 + Abar1)_{ck} + (N0 + Abar0)_{ck} W_k ],
  the same formula as Stage E with W_k replaced. R_i only needs to exceed eta_i r*, so it can be small, and MH is then
  close to the Hessian along the orbit (the float estimate at g = 0.0275 gives Z2 about 200 with optimised eta).
  The polydisc cover is computed once per group of pieces, for a family Phi whose coefficient balls contain every
  centre of the group (checked with acb.contains) and with g the hull of the group's intervals.

5. Continuity in g and gluing (Theorem B3)
------------------------------------------
On a piece G: by (0.1), F(x; g) - F(x; g') = (g - g') F1(x), F1(x) = (0, (-[f1 o phi_a]_m)_m), and f1 = (f(.; g_hi) -
f(.; g_lo)) / (g_hi - g_lo) is holomorphic on the same domain U, so by the argument of Lemma B2(a) (one order lower)
sup_{x in B_{r_hi}} ||A F1(x)|| =: L < inf (A is bounded on X: A_fin is a matrix and sup_{|m|>K} |A_m| <= Abar0).
Hence ||T_g(x) - T_g'(x)|| <= L |g - g'| uniformly on the ball, and with kappa = Z1 + Z2 r_hi < 1,
    ||x*(g) - x*(g')|| = ||T_g(x*(g)) - T_g'(x*(g'))|| <= L |g - g'| + kappa ||x*(g) - x*(g')||,
so g -> x*(g) is Lipschitz on G (uniform contraction principle); in particular omega*(g) and T(g) = 2 pi / omega*(g)
are continuous. (By the implicit function theorem x* is even real analytic in g, not used.)
Gluing. Pieces P_i = [lo_i, hi_i] with lo_{i+1} < hi_i (an overlap interval O_i = [lo_{i+1}, hi_i]). The program checks,
in Arb, that the existence ball of piece i lies inside the uniqueness ball of piece i+1:
    ||xbar_i - xbar_{i+1}||_{eta(i+1)} + r_lo(i) max_c (eta_c(i) / eta_c(i+1)) <= r_hi(i+1)
(the norm of the exact difference of the two centres, in the weights of piece i+1; the max converts piece i's norm).
Then for every g in O_i, x*_i(g) is a zero of F(.; g) in the uniqueness ball of piece i+1, so x*_i(g) = x*_{i+1}(g).
Non-consecutive overlaps (P_i meets P_j with j >= i + 2). collect() and validate_logs() require (and refuse the
record otherwise) that, in the order of the lower ends, both endpoints increase strictly (lo_i < lo_{i+1} and
hi_i < hi_{i+1}) and that every piece has r_lo < r_hi (exact comparison). Then x*_i = x*_j on P_i n P_j as well:
  (a) an agreement point. g0 := lo_j lies in P_i n P_j and in every P_k, i < k < j: lo_k <= lo_j = g0, and
      hi_k >= hi_i >= lo_j (P_i meets P_j). So g0 lies in each consecutive overlap O_k (i <= k < j), and the
      consecutive identities give x*_i(g0) = x*_{i+1}(g0) = ... = x*_j(g0).
  (b) closed-open. The set E = {g in P_i n P_j : x*_i(g) = x*_j(g)} is closed in the interval P_i n P_j (both maps are
      continuous). It is open there: if g1 is in E, then x*_i(g1) = x*_j(g1) lies in the closed ball of radius r_lo(j)
      about xbar_j (existence on piece j), which is inside the open ball of radius r_hi(j) since r_lo(j) < r_hi(j); by
      continuity of x*_i, for g in P_i n P_j near g1, x*_i(g) lies in that open ball, hence in piece j's uniqueness
      ball, and it is a zero of F(.; g) with g in P_j, so x*_i(g) = x*_j(g).
  An interval is connected, and E is nonempty by (a), so E = P_i n P_j.
The map g -> x*(g), defined piecewise, is therefore single valued and continuous on the union [lo_1, hi_last]: one
connected curve of real periodic orbits.

6. Stability along the branch (pointwise here; uniform in Theorem C)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Uniform stability on each piece is proved separately, by fourier/branch_stability.py (Theorem C, lemmas in
LEMMAS-stability.md section 10, record results/fourier-branch-stability.json): it locates x*(g) to second order about
the affine centre xbar + (g - g_c) xbar_1 and applies Theorem 3 at every g with a comparison operator that is affine
in g. What follows describes the pointwise route of this file and why feeding a piece to Stage S directly fails.
fourier/stability.py (Stage S) certifies, for one zero x* with a radius r >= ||x* - xbar||, that every nontrivial
Floquet multiplier has modulus <= e^{-delta T}. It accepts an input dictionary (certify(N, inp=...)), so it can be fed
J enclosures over a parameter interval; but its perturbation term eps (Lemma 4.1 of LEMMAS-stability.md: Cauchy,
M_k / R times (P - 1), about linear in r / R, then multiplied by the cell scalings 2^{e_l - e_k} up to 2^30) must stay
far below the margin delta (about 4e-5). On a piece r_lo is about ||dx/dg|| (g_hi - g_lo) / 2, 1e-4 to 1e-3 in these
units, so the run with the piece's data cannot close; this is recorded once (stability_uniform_attempt in the record).
What is run instead (stability_points): at selected exact decimals g_s, a point proof (prove_piece with
g_lo = g_hi = g_s, K = 32, a 256-bit Arb-refined centre, weights 1, Stage E's precisions POINT_SETTINGS, so r_lo is
about 1e-28; a K = 12 double centre gives r = 4e-14 and theta_T = 540 in Stage S), then Stage S with
delta = 0.85 |float leading nontrivial exponent| at g_s. These give stability at those points only. A point's orbit is the branch orbit at that g
only if the program checks it (point_on_branch, in Arb): g lies in a piece and the point's existence ball (K = 32,
weights 1) lies in that piece's uniqueness ball, ||xbar_pt - xbar_piece||_{eta(piece)} + r_lo(pt) max_c (1 / eta_c(piece))
<= r_hi(piece), the K = 12 centre padded with exact zeros; then the point's zero of F(.; g) is x*_piece(g) by
uniqueness. Every piece of the record carries a stability statement: "pointwise" at the checked points it contains,
otherwise "none" with the nearest checked points on either side. Points beyond the certified interval (or whose check
fails) are recorded as isolated results (existence and stability at that g; that the orbit is the continuation of
the branch is not proved there). The uniform attempt is reproducible (uniform_stability_attempt). What uniform stability on a piece would need: an eps of the size of
the true variation of J along the piece (about |D^2 f| ||dx/dg|| |g - g_c|, already about 0.1 for 1e-6 wide pieces)
is still 2e3 times the margin, so either pieces about 1e-10 wide, or a perturbation bound for the critical Floquet
exponents that uses the structure (they move by about |d mu / dg| |g - g_c|, tiny) rather than the norm of the
perturbation of the Hill operator.

7. Real solution, period, phase (as E.7, with the new phase functional)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
kappa(omega, a) = (conj omega, (conj a_{-m})_m) is an isometry of X, kappa(xbar) = xbar, and F(kappa x; g) =
kappa'(F(x; g)) with kappa'(F_ph, (F_m)) = (-conj F_ph, (conj F_{-m})) (F_ph(kappa x) = conj a_{-1,V} - conj a_{1,V}); g is
real, so the E.7 argument (f(conj z; g) = conj f(z; g) pointwise on the certified domain) holds for each g in G.
Hence x*(g) = kappa x*(g) by uniqueness: omega* real, phi* real, and Im a*_{1,V} = 0. The program checks
|abar_{1,V}| > eta_V r_lo / nu, so a*_{1,V} != 0 for every g in G: phi* has minimal period 2 pi and the solution
z(t) = phi*(omega* t) has minimal period T = 2 pi / omega*, with T in [2 pi / (omega_bar + eta_om r_lo),
2 pi / (omega_bar - eta_om r_lo)] for every g in G.

8. Untrusted inputs
-------------------
Centres of the pieces: float Galerkin-Newton (K = 12, Fourier phase, continuation in g with the tangent predictor),
rounded to exact doubles with Im a_{1,V} set to exactly 0 and exact conjugate symmetry (their residual, about 1e-15,
is negligible next to the parameter-width term of Y0). Centres of the point proofs (section 6): K = 32, refined by an
Arb chord iteration at 256 bits at the exact decimal g_s. A_fin, the weights eta (a float search on the rigorous
weight-free blocks), r_*, the radii R_i = 32 eta_i r_*, the piece boundaries (multiples of 1e-12), the bridges and
splits are chosen by floating-point code; they are exact numbers whose quality only decides whether the
inequalities hold.

8a. Resume and log validation (driver only; no bound depends on it)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
run() resumes from the run log. validate_logs first drops an unparsable LAST line of the run log or the centres file
(a process killed while appending; kept in <file>.truncated), moves the pieces of a group without its group record
to run_K<K>.orphans.jsonl (they are proved again), checks group numbering, piece counts, group overlap and every
centre's SHA-256, and re-derives every gluing inequality in Arb. The first piece of the resumed run is glued to the
last logged piece by the same Arb check (glue) before anything is logged, so a resumed branch is connected by
checked inequalities, never by trust in the log. collect() repeats the gluing from the stored exact data.

8b. Why the pieces shrink toward the Hopf point (float data, section 9)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The admissible half-width is about (1 - Z1)^2 / (2 Z2 ||A d_gF||). Toward the Hopf point the orbit's amplitude
(|a_{1,V}|, V range 0.116 mV at 0.0275, 0.016 mV at 0.0279) tends to 0: the phase row and the tangent direction
degenerate, ||A|| (eta = 1) grows from 2.7e5 to 1.2e6 at 0.0279 and 2.5e6 at 0.027905, and ||dx/dg|| from 1.2e3 to
3.3e3 and 5.0e3, while the amplitude behaves like (g_H - g)^{1/2} (|a_{1,V}| falls by 7.4 while g_H - g falls by
51.6 between 0.0275 and 0.0279; sqrt(51.6) = 7.2). The predicted admissible half-width
falls from 5.3e-6 (0.0275) to 3.2e-8 (0.0279) and 7.5e-9 (0.027905), and the gluing condition (existence ball of one
piece inside the uniqueness ball of the next) caps the usable fraction of it. A proof up to the Hopf point needs
coordinates in which the orbit does not collapse (amplitude-scaled unknowns, a blow-up of the Hopf point); none is
attempted, and nothing is claimed at the Hopf point.

9. Float exploration (non-rigorous, `explore`)
-----------------------------------------------
Galerkin-Newton continuation in g with the Fourier phase, Hill-matrix Floquet exponents, ||A||, ||dx/dg|| and the
predicted admissible half-width (1 - Z1)^2 / (2 Z2 ||dx/dg||) from float block norms and Hessians. It locates the
branch; it is not part of any proof.
