The complete original stability and Hopf suites, branch quick checks and fresh tracked-companion reproduction passed their recorded in-project checks.

Release 1.0.0 remains available at [doi:10.5281/zenodo.23101322](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.23101322); earlier immutable archives and their evidence remain unchanged.

**Working revision after 1.1.0 (2026-10-03).** The manuscript and PDF on this branch correct the description of
capacitance-dependent concentration terms and clarify that potassium clamping modifies the equations. The

## Conductance extension and limits

Theorem D adds a computer-assisted single-cell
continuation on the exact G_Ks interval [0.027499735464, 0.02778996093] with 712 pieces and 711 adjacent inclusions;
uniform stability throughout that entire lower interval using 63 group or subgroup certificates, with no individual
fallback certificate in the final cover, delta = 3e-5 per ms and every nontrivial multiplier at most 0.998413816;
and a connected 68-piece amplitude family, with 67 inclusions and a zero-amplitude identity, joining it to the
supercritical Hopf equilibrium. Current collected records and their independent in-project numerical reviews are
necessary evidence, rather than a publication or outside-review decision.

The sole fresh bridge point, G_Ks = 0.02778, has an existence-only proof. Its stability follows through identity with
the separately admitted uniform branch cover, not an inherited Stage S point success. No historical pointwise
stability success is promoted. Local small-amplitude Hopf stability has no computed neighborhood size and does not
imply uniform stability throughout the whole bridge. There is no certified global monotonicity, global orbit
uniqueness at fixed conductance, tissue claim, clinical implication or action-potential claim. The all-N and cable
results of Theorem C retain their original fixed conductance and stability scope.

The amplitude normalization uses fixed scaled TP06 coordinates: a1,V = epsilon/2 there, with physical
|Vhat1| = epsilon/8 mV. Validated continuation, analytic nonpolynomial estimates, amplitude desingularization and
transformed-ball gluing build on established work by van den Berg, Queirolo and Lessard. The complete published
2021 Hopf article and the complete 46-page March 22, 2019 continuation preprint were read; the final typeset
continuation article was not read in full. The bounded Erhardt (2025) forward-citation search and exact access scope
are recorded in `review/method-reading-and-forward-citations-2026-10-02.md`. These searches do not establish priority.

## Abstract

We give computer-assisted proofs for Erhardt's 18-state modification of the ten Tusscher-Panfilov 2006 endocardial
ventricular cell model at slow delayed rectifier conductance G_Ks = 0.0275 nS/pF, 1.46 per cent below the first
supercritical Hopf point he computed numerically. Rings of N identical cells, coupled diffusively through the voltage with strength N^2/64000 per ms,
discretize the cable u_t = f(u) + D u_xx, D = 1/64000 per ms, on a ring of length 1. Rotating waves there are expected
from equivariant Hopf theory; we prove them at explicit parameters.

For one cell, two proofs (CAPD and Arb, sharing only GMP and MPFR) give an orbitally asymptotically stable periodic
orbit, with 17 nontrivial Floquet multipliers below 0.998642 and 0.997859 respectively, and an exact rational check
shows both enclose the same orbit. For N = 8, 16, 32, 64 a rotating 1-wave exists, is locally unique and not
synchronous, has minimal period T = 2 pi/omega enclosed to within 2e-25 ms, and is locally exponentially orbitally
stable: the multiplier 1 is algebraically simple and the other 18N - 1 have modulus below e^(-delta T) < 0.9997321,
delta = 5e-6 per ms. A locally unique rotating 1-wave also exists for every N >= 8, and a traveling wave for the cable,
the limit of the ring waves.

Existence is a radii-polynomial argument in a weighted l^1 space, made uniform over epsilon in [0, 1/64] (1/N^2 for the
rings, 0 for the cable) in 73 pieces glued by ball inclusion. Stability rests on one Hill operator whose spectrum gives
every Floquet multiplier with its algebraic multiplicity; a Riesz-projection homotopy shows it meets {Re mu >= -delta}
only in the eigenvalues i omega N Z, each algebraically simple. Stability is proved only for the cell and these four
rings. For the single cell, a connected conductance family reaches a certified supercritical Hopf endpoint. Its 712-piece lower interval has uniform nontrivial multiplier bound 0.998413816, and a 68-piece amplitude family supplies the bridge. Quantitative uniform stability is proved only on the lower interval. Nothing is claimed for tissue.

## Released 1.0.0 results

- **Computer-assisted** (written proofs in `paper/cardiac-rings.tex`, inequalities decided in exact rational,
  interval or ball arithmetic):
  - Theorem A(i), the cell by CAPD: record `data/cell-gks0.0275.json` (verified; 732 s).
  - Theorem A(iii), the two cell proofs enclose the same orbit: `code/fourier/link_cell.py` (exact rationals,
    standard library), output `data/link_cell.txt`. Part (i) assumes that the CAPD program evaluates Erhardt's
    function and part (ii) that the Arb program does; (iii) uses both assumptions together. The two programs were
    compared at 104 points by the tests, not proved equal.
  - Theorem A(ii) and Theorem B, the cell and the rings N = 8, 16, 32, 64 in Fourier space: records
    `data/fourier-existence-N*.json` (Stage E, the existence proof) and `data/fourier-stability-N*.json` (Stage S,
    the stability proof).
  - The records keep the status their programs wrote ("computed; awaiting adversarial review"). The in-project review
    outcome, "passed in-project adversarial review", is recorded in `data/fourier-review-status.json`, outside the
    hashed records, so that recording it does not break the hash chain from Stage S to Stage E.
  - Theorem C, every ring size N >= 8 and the continuum cable (existence, local uniqueness, minimal period, continuity
    in epsilon = 1/N^2, convergence as N tends to infinity): record `data/fourier-existence-alln.json` (73 pieces of
    [0, 1/64]), written by `code/fourier/alln.py` from the run log `code/fourier/data/alln/pieces.jsonl`. For
    N = 8, 16, 32, 64 the record identifies the wave with the wave of Theorem B, so Theorem B's stability applies to it;
    for every other N, and for the cable, stability is not claimed. Four constants that the theorem states for all
    pieces together (the largest r_ex, the smallest r_un, the smallest r_un times the smallest weight, which gives the
    unweighted uniqueness radius 1.05e-6, and the largest weight) are read off the record by an exact rational check,
    given with its output in `review/third-reading-2026-10-02.md`. The record's `theorem` string writes the profile
    equation as omega phi' = f(phi) - L_eps phi, with L_eps acting on mode m as +d_m(eps) E; this is the negative of
    the manuscript's L_eps, so the two equations are the same. The program had an in-project adversarial reading
    (`review/alln-existence-review-2026-10-02.md`: nothing unsound, four weak tests and four minor items, fixed by the
    program's author without changing any bound, `review/alln-existence-fixcheck-2026-10-02.md`); the record keeps the
    status its program wrote, and `data/fourier-review-status.json` does not list it yet.
- **Proved** (written proofs, no computation of their own): the lemmas, propositions, corollaries and theorems of
  Sections 4 and 5 on which the computer-assisted theorems rest, among them Theorem 5.3 (Hill sectors) and the
  certificate theorems of Section 5, whose hypotheses the programs check, and Appendix A, which proves the facts about
  operators with compact resolvent from elementary facts (Kato is cited as "see also" only). Lemma 6.1, the link of
  the two cell proofs, is computer-assisted (exact rationals, `code/fourier/link_cell.py`).
- **Numerical, not proved** (Section 7 of the manuscript): the floating-point leading exponents; the sharpness of the
  N = 8 certificate (passes at delta = 6.32095e-6, fails at 6.321e-6, in runs not kept as records); the Hopf point
  (`data/numerics-hopf-orbit.json`); that these orbits lie on the branch born at Erhardt's first Hopf point (an
  inference from these observations: no branch was continued in G_Ks); the negative
  controls of Theorem C; and the comparison with the weak-coupling phase reduction (Remark 7.1,
  `code/numerics/phase_reduction.py`, `data/numerics-phase-reduction.json`), which predicts the period shifts to within
  0.82 per cent and the leading exponents to within 3.5 per cent, and fails for the short-wavelength ring modes when
  N >= 16.
- **Consistency check, not part of this paper:** an independent computation with CAPD made earlier in the project,
  whose records stay in the project's development repository, enclosed the periods of the cell and of the 8- and
  16-cell waves in intervals that contain the periods proved here.
- **Not claimed:** anything about the published 19-state TP06 cell, action potentials, reentry or tissue; N < 8;
  stability for N other than 8, 16, 32, 64, for the cable, or uniformly in N; a rate of convergence as N tends to
  infinity. The released 1.0.0 did not certify conductance continuation. The 1.1.0 extension above concerns only the single cell.
- **Checks made:** in-project adversarial readings of the programs and of the stability lemmas, and a second reading
  of their fixes; a review of the CAPD verifier, which led to its hardening and to the CAPD patch in `code/proofs/`; a
  first reading of this manuscript (`review/manuscript-reading-1-2026-10-01.md`) and a second reading of the revised
  draft (`review/manuscript-reading-2-2026-10-01.md`), whose corrections are made and listed in
  `review/fix-check-2026-10-01.md`; a reading of Appendix A (`review/appendixA-reading-2026-10-02.md`); and the
  reading of the program of Theorem C above; and a third reading of the whole manuscript on 2026-10-02, in five parts
  with every finding checked by two further sessions (`review/third-reading-2026-10-02.md`: no gap in the proofs;
  its confirmed findings are fixed, and the fixes have not been read by a further reader). The index of these files
  is [`review/README.md`](review/README.md). On 2026-10-01 the proofs for N = 1 and 8 were rerun from the copies in
  `code/`; on 2026-10-02 the CAPD certificate, the proofs for N = 16, 32 and 64, the collection step of Theorem C and
  `code/fourier/test_alln.py` (13 tests, four of the 73 pieces re-proved bit for bit), and the proof for N = 1 again
  from a fresh copy of this folder with its `code/requirements.txt`; Section 8 of the manuscript gives the outcome.
  None of these checks is an outside review.
- **Earlier work, as far as the searches reached:** the prior-article searches of 2026-09-30 and 2026-10-01, whose
  scope and limits Section 9 of the manuscript records, found no earlier computer-assisted proof of a periodic orbit
  of a detailed ionic cardiac cell model and none of a rotating wave in a ring of diffusively coupled cells; the
  nearest computer-assisted precedent for the cyclic-shift symmetry is Kapela and Zgliczynski's N-body choreographies
  (Nonlinearity 16 (2003) 1899-1918), which the paper cites. Nothing more is claimed; in particular the searches did not
  cover traveling waves of continuum cables, and no novelty is claimed for the cable wave of Theorem C. The
  oscillation of the cell is predicted by Erhardt's numerical continuation (Front. Phys. 13 (2025) 1569121), and the
  existence of rotating waves near a Hopf point of a ring is the generic expectation of Z_N-equivariant Hopf theory.

## The model

A. H. Erhardt's 18-state K_i-clamped, smoothed TP06 endocardial model (`fun_eval` of
`bifurcation analysis/TP06_18d_endo_bif.m`, GitHub repository
andreerhardt/cardiac-dynamics-of-a-human-ventricular-tissue-model-with-focus-on-early-afterdepolarizations, commit
dc78f86, MIT License), which differs from the published TP06 cell in four ways: K_i is held at 138.3 mM; the Heaviside
switch at V = -40 mV in the h and j rates is replaced by 1/(1 + exp(-5(V + 40))); G_Kr = 0.0153 and G_CaL = 0.000199
(0.1 and 5 times the endocardial values), with G_Ks = 0.0275; and C_m = 1 multiplies the membrane-current
contributions to the Ca_i, Ca_ss and Na_i balances, with coefficients about 5.405 times those in the convention of
the CellML-derived version of TP06 in the same repository, which uses 0.185 for the cell capacitance. Internal calcium
uptake, leak, release and transfer terms do not carry this factor. Holding K_i fixed modifies the differential
equations; the generally nonzero omitted potassium balance prevents identifying it with a conserved-charge leaf
of the full 19-state model. These results concern the specified 18-state model. The ring is
dx_j/dt = f(x_j) + c E (x_{j-1} - 2 x_j + x_{j+1}), c = N^2/64000 per ms, E the projection on V.

## Programs

The canonical programs and records are copied from the development repository. Version 1.1.0 copies current
reviewed Fourier programs and inputs byte for byte into `code/`, and
current records into `data/`. Source and input hashes retain their original execution-layout paths. A companion
basename is not a freshness or acceptance check; the collectors validate the current source-bound complete logs.

The unchanged all-N certificate of released 1.0.0 hashes an older `fourier/branch.py`. Those exact bytes are retained
as `code/fourier/branch-1.0.0.py` (SHA-256
`97f7bbc586727bdab51a412d2b5b304fd6f858b79826f6c0319ef462ffbe29fa`). For historical provenance and `alln` collection,
`run_all.sh` verifies this archive against the unchanged all-N record and restores it as `fourier/branch.py` in its
historical scratch layout. The `continuation` target uses a separate fresh scratch copy with the current
`code/fourier/branch.py`. No record is rebound to a changed source. The 73 original all-N pieces are not claimed
reproved by these continuation collections.

`code/run_all.sh`, `code/requirements.txt` and the plotting program are companion orchestration. The plot is not a
proof. Historical prototype and seed files remain untrusted starting guesses, never numerical bounds. Records keep
the producer status strings; separate reviews and acceptance receipts document in-project decisions without
rewriting the hash chain. Paths under `reviews/` in original records refer to the development folder and are copied
into companion `review/` with their original names.

## Reproduce

From this folder:

```
python3.12 -m pip install -r code/requirements.txt
sh code/run_all.sh                 # stored source/input provenance (counts reported from actual records) and the exact cell link
sh code/run_all.sh continuation    # Theorem D: final branch/uniform/Hopf collectors and strict comparison, scratch only
sh code/run_all.sh alln            # Theorem C: re-derive the gluing and the Stage E identifications in Arb (under a minute)
sh code/run_all.sh 1,8             # rerun Stage E and Stage S for N = 1 and 8 (about 5 minutes)
sh code/run_all.sh 1,8,16,32,64    # all five (about 25 minutes; Stage S at N = 64 needs about 3.6 GB)
python3 code/plot_cardiac_rings.py # the figures (seconds; numpy and matplotlib; no proof is rerun)
```

Four of the 73 pieces of Theorem C (those containing eps = 0 and 1/4096, 1/1024, 1/256 and 1/64) are re-proved from
their stored inputs by `code/fourier/test_alln.py` (about 10 to 15 minutes on a shared machine; the command is in its
docstring), run in a folder staged as `run_all.sh` stages one (the
contents of `code/`, with `data/fourier-*.json` copied to `results/`, and the verified `branch-1.0.0.py` archive
restored as `fourier/branch.py` for this historical test).

The 1.1 Linux producer runtime is Python 3.12 on Ubuntu 24.04 x86_64 with python-flint 0.9.0 / FLINT 3.6.0.
Download the wheel named in `code/requirements.txt`, verify SHA-256
`376b88cacd30612479e839ffdba887599d3f9c8c0e214852bf80bb2b194e4d76`, install those exact bytes, and run
`test_arbmodel.py --wheel <wheel>` before numerical checks. Preserve the runtime and native control output.
Historical 1.0 records used Python 3.11.15. Package versions alone do not prove wheel identity or cross-platform
bitwise equality. Native Mac proofs can have different untrusted floating-point centers and inverse proposals.

`continuation` (alias `branch`, combinable as `alln,continuation`) rederives the complete current branch and all
711 inclusions, collects the uniform cover, then freshly rederives all 67 amplitude inclusions, the zero-amplitude
identity and the point-to-amplitude/point-to-branch bridge. It compares typed exact source/input/settings/log hashes
and mathematical fields with `data/`. Every original uniform receipt also passes a direct exact conservative
tube check: kappa_check = max(kappa_stored, Z1_path + Z2*rho) for group units, the corresponding affine formula
for piece units, kappa_check < 1 and Yprime <= (1-kappa_check)*rho, with exact radius/domain validity checks.
The original source-bound SC producer proof is retained; full finite SC vectors are not serialized, so this collector
check does not recompute those vectors. It runs no 712- or 68-piece numerical reproof by default and has a 1200-second
collector cap, rather than a promised runtime. Runtime metadata may differ. Only the freshly validated common
zero-endpoint equilibrium polydisc and its contraction diagnostics may differ numerically; these differences require
fresh strict contraction and both inclusion checks, not a tolerance-based comparison. Relocated log paths retain
the same exact basenames, counts and hashes. The branch Y0/cap display diagnostic is recomputed as an exact ratio
from the unchanged dyadic proof bounds; any platform-dependent display rounding is printed with both values and
the exact ratio, without altering a proof bound or applying a numerical tolerance. Complete original numerical suites are a separate acceptance gate.

The script stages `code/` in a scratch folder, because the programs write their records to `<root>/results`, and never
touches `data/`. Expect the period enclosures and the stability bounds to agree exactly with `data/`, and the binary
values of Y0, Z1, Z2 and r_existence to differ from about the 14th significant digit (Y0 only beyond its 25 printed
digits): `run_all.sh` runs `existence.py` with one BLAS thread, the stored records do not record their thread
settings, and the untrusted floating-point inverse may depend on them (Section 8 of the manuscript). What is
certified are the stored records in `data/`; the Stage S records hash the Stage E records they read.

The CAPD certificate of Theorem A(i) needs CAPD 6.1.0 at commit 03dc5628203334b214bb7d9fd63788a175521005, configured
with CMake with CAPD_INTERVAL_TYPE=FILIB (the default; filib is bundled in capdExt/filibsrc) and
CAPD_ENABLE_MULTIPRECISION=true (GMP and MPFR), with `git apply code/proofs/capd-6.1.0-genchase.patch` from the CAPD
source root. Build the verifier from `code/` with
`g++ -O2 -std=c++17 proofs/verify.cpp -o verify $(<capd-install>/bin/capd-config --cflags --libs)` (capd-config
supplies `-frounding-math`, `-D__USE_FILIB__` and `-D__HAVE_MPFR__`). Then
`python3 code/proofs/certify.py <verify binary> code/candidates/cell_frameF.txt <record.json> --N 1 --gks 0.0275 --env VERIFY_MP_BITS=128 --env VERIFY_MP_TOL=1e-24 --env VERIFY_MP_ORDER=30`.
Compare the new record with `data/cell-gks0.0275.json`: the keys `verified`, `verifier_exit`, `claim`,
`settings_env`, the hashes of the frame and of the four sources, `capd_commit`, `capd_patch`, `stdout_tail`,
`stderr_tail` and the whole `verifier` object (28 keys) should be identical; `hashes.verify_binary`, `wall_seconds`,
`repository_commit` and the dirty flag will differ. The stored record was written by an earlier version of
`certify.py`, which wrote `working_tree_dirty` (the current one writes `sources_dirty`), and its fields
`sources_match_commit` and `note` were added by hand. Outside a git checkout `repository_commit` is empty and
`sources_dirty` carries no information. The rerun of 2026-10-02 found all of the first group identical.
`certify.py` contains the absolute path of the patched header in the session where it ran (`CAPD_PATCHED_HEADER`);
edit it to point at your CAPD installation, or the record will say that the patch was not detected. The copy here is
unchanged so that it matches the study's file.

The comparison of the two translations of the model (Theorem A(iii)) is `test_b_capd` in
`code/fourier/test_arbmodel.py`. Build the field printer against the same CAPD installation, from `code/`, with
`g++ -O2 -std=c++17 numerics/compare_rhs.cpp -o compare_rhs $(capd-config --cflags --libs)`, then run
`python3 code/fourier/test_arbmodel.py --capd <compare_rhs>` (about 15 s), adding `--wheel <the python-flint 0.9.0
wheel>` to check the wheel's SHA-256 against the pin in `code/fourier/arbmodel.py`; the wheel hash is checked only when
the wheel is given. These two commands were not rerun from this folder.

The manuscript is built with `pdflatex cardiac-rings.tex`, run three times in `paper/`.
